# Matching Prefixes

This Golang project demonstrates the efficient finding of the longest matching prefix for a given input string.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and execute the following commands in your terminal: This command compiles the project.

   ```bash
   go build
3. Run below command to execute the generated binary file.
    ```bash
    ./matching_prefixes
    
4. Alternatively, you can run the project directly without building:
    ```bash
    go run main.go

## Usage

1. Modify the prefixes.txt file to include the desired prefixes, ensuring each prefix is on a separate line.
2. Run the program and provide the input string to find the longest matching prefix.

## Testing

1. To run the test suite, execute the following command in the project directory:
    ```bash
    go test ./tests

2. This command will execute the test cases and provide you with the test results.


## Note

Make sure to replace `./matching_prefixes` with the appropriate executable file name if you are not using Windows. This updated README provides clear instructions for installation, usage, and testing of the project.
